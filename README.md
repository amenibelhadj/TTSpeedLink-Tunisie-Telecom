# TTSpeedLink Project - README

## Introduction

Welcome to the TTSpeedLink project README! This document provides an overview of the TTSpeedLink application developed using Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MySQL. TTSpeedLink is a comprehensive system designed to streamline various aspects of your business operations, including reseller management, customer accounts, inventory control, SIM card administration, invoicing, and more.

## Modules Developed

### Reseller Management

The Reseller Management module allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on reseller information. Additionally, it facilitates the assignment of resellers to specific stores or boutiques.

### Customer Account Management

The Customer Account Management module offers a unique feature for inputting customer data by scanning their identification cards. This process simplifies and expedites the entry of customer information into the system.

### Authentication and Security

Our application incorporates robust security measures, including hashed passwords, session management, and cookie handling. This ensures that user authentication is secure and their interactions with the platform remain protected.

### Inventory Control

The Inventory Control module provides tools for managing stock levels efficiently. Admins can track and manage available products, ensuring that stockouts and overstocking are minimized.

### SIM Card Management

This module automates the generation of PIN codes for SIM cards and enables easy entry of SIM card information by specifying number ranges. The system also features the automatic activation of SIM cards after they are sold.

### Invoicing

The Invoicing module enables the generation and management of invoices for sales transactions. This simplifies the billing process and enhances the overall customer experience.

### Automatic SIM Card Activation

After a successful sale, the Automatic SIM Card Activation module ensures that the purchased SIM card is promptly activated, reducing manual intervention and enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard provides a clear and comprehensive overview for administrators. It includes insights into sales data, popular products, recurring regions, and other relevant business metrics. This visual representation enhances decision-making and allows for better strategic planning.
